# ZendeskTicketViewer
Day 1: Now it will give me how many tickets in total and display them in a list,
          then what I will do next will be scan input and react. 
          Also, the main method and related method have been created. Tomorrow, I will merge these two together
          
          
Day 2: It is working now, the last thing I need to do is figure it out how to do the page through
